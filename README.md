# Generalized Partial Coherence (GPC)
Generalized Partial Coherence (GPC) quantifies frequency coupling between two time series conditioned on the activity of other time series without making any model assumptions. Furthermore, GPC is not limited to same-frequency coupling resulting from linear interactions but also can address cross-frequency coupling resulting from nonlinear interactions.

## Installation
GDI was tested using Python 3.7, and requires the following packages:
- NumPy
- SciPy
- seaborn
- TensorFlow (<v2.0)

GPC also requires [CCMI](https://github.com/sudiptodip15/CCMI). Please place the `CIT` folder of CCMI into the root directory of GPC, i.e. at the same directory level as this README.

## Usage
The `GPC.py` file contains all functions used for GPC. The core functions are:
- `hi`: Hi

For more detail, view the header for each function in the `GPC.py` file.

## Minimal Working Example
The
```python
import GPC
import numpy as np
```
